# "Paxos Made Moderately Complex" Made Moderately Simple

## The Challenge: Making Paxos Practical

In distributed systems, we often need to implement state machine replication—a fundamental technique for building reliable, fault-tolerant systems. The basic idea is simple: we want multiple machines to agree on the order of operations, but implementing this in practice can be surprisingly complex.

This document explores "Paxos Made Moderately Complex" (PMMC), which is a practical implementation of the Paxos consensus algorithm. While the original Paxos algorithm is elegant and theoretically sound, implementing it in real systems requires addressing many practical concerns that the theory doesn't cover.

### The Goal: State Machine Replication

**State Machine Replication**: We want multiple machines to agree on the order of operations.

**The Problem**: How do we ensure that all machines execute the same operations in the same order?

**The Solution**: Use consensus to agree on the order of operations.

**The Result**: All machines end up in the same state, ensuring consistency.

### The Operation Log: A Simple Abstraction

**The Idea**: Think of operations as a log that all machines must agree on.

**The Log**: Op1, Op2, Op3, Op4, Op5, Op6...

**The Challenge**: All machines must agree on what goes in each position of the log.

**The Power**: Once we agree on the log, we can execute the operations in order to maintain consistency.

### A Concrete Example: Distributed Key-Value Store

**The Scenario**: Three servers (S1, S2, S3) need to agree on the order of operations.

**The Operations**: 
- "Put k1 v1" (set key k1 to value v1)
- "Put k2 v2" (set key k2 to value v2)

**The Challenge**: Multiple clients might send requests simultaneously, and we need to agree on the order.

**The Solution**: Use Paxos to agree on the order of operations in the log.

### The Basic Paxos Algorithm

**Paxos Structure**: Paxos consists of two phases:

**Phase 1**: Send prepare messages and pick value to accept.

**Phase 2**: Send accept messages to commit the value.

**The Result**: This two-phase approach ensures consensus.

### The Key Insight: Can We Do Better?

**The Question**: Can we optimize the basic Paxos algorithm for better performance?

**The Analysis**: 
- **Phase 1**: "Leader election" - deciding whose value we will use
- **Phase 2**: "Commit" - leader makes sure it's still leader, commits value

**The Optimization**: What if we split these phases?

**The Benefit**: Lets us do operations with one round-trip instead of two!

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: By separating leader election from value commitment, we can optimize the common case.

**The Elegance**: The algorithm becomes more efficient while maintaining correctness.

**The Result**: We can build practical distributed systems that perform well in real-world scenarios.

## Roles in PMMC: Who Does What

Now let's explore how PMMC organizes the system into different roles, each with specific responsibilities.

### The Three Main Roles

**Replicas (like learners)**: Keep log of operations, state machine, configs.

**What This Means**: 
- **Log of Operations**: Maintain the sequence of operations that have been agreed upon
- **State Machine**: Execute the operations to maintain the current state
- **Configs**: Store configuration information about the system

**The Power**: Replicas are the workhorses that actually execute the operations and maintain the system state.

**Leaders (like proposers)**: Get elected, drive the consensus protocol.

**What This Means**:
- **Get Elected**: Win the right to propose values to the system
- **Drive Consensus**: Coordinate the consensus process and ensure progress

**The Power**: Leaders are the coordinators that make decisions and drive the system forward.

**Acceptors (simpler than in Paxos Made Simple!)**: "Vote" on leaders.

**What This Means**:
- **Vote on Leaders**: Participate in leader election by accepting or rejecting leader proposals
- **Simpler**: The acceptor role is simplified compared to the original Paxos algorithm

**The Power**: Acceptors provide the fault tolerance that makes the system reliable.

### The Key Insight

**The Key Realization**: By separating concerns into distinct roles, PMMC makes the system easier to understand and implement.

**The Elegance**: Each role has a clear, focused responsibility.

**The Result**: The system becomes more maintainable and easier to reason about.

## Ballot Numbers: Ensuring Uniqueness and Ordering

Now let's explore how PMMC uses ballot numbers to ensure that leaders can be uniquely identified and ordered.

### The Basic Ballot Structure

**Ballot Format**: (leader, seqnum) pairs.

**What This Means**:
- **Leader**: The identifier of the leader proposing the ballot
- **Seqnum**: A sequence number that increases over time

**The Power**: This structure ensures that each ballot is unique and can be ordered.

### The Original Ballot System

**The System**: Isomorphic to the system we discussed earlier.

**The Structure**:
- **Leader 0**: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, …
- **Leader 1**: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, …
- **Leader 2**: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, …
- **Leader 3**: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, …

**What This Means**: Each leader gets every 4th sequence number, ensuring no conflicts.

**The Result**: Ballots can be easily compared and ordered.

### The PMMC Ballot System

**The Structure**:
- **Leader 0**: 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, …
- **Leader 1**: 0.1, 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, …
- **Leader 2**: 0.2, 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, …
- **Leader 3**: 0.3, 1.3, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3, …

**What This Means**: Each leader gets a unique sequence number for each round.

**The Power**: This system provides even better uniqueness guarantees.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Ballot numbers provide a way to order and compare different leader proposals.

**The Elegance**: The system ensures that no two leaders can have the same ballot number.

**The Result**: The system can always determine which leader has the highest ballot number.

## The Acceptor Protocol: How Acceptors Work

Now let's dive into how acceptors actually work in PMMC, including the key protocols they follow.

### The Acceptor State

**What Acceptors Track**:
- **ballot_num**: The highest ballot number they've seen
- **accepted**: A list of accepted proposals

**The Power**: This state allows acceptors to make informed decisions about which proposals to accept.

### The P1A Protocol: Phase 1a (Prepare)

**The Process**: When an acceptor receives a p1a message with a ballot number:

**The Rules**:
1. If the ballot number is higher than what they've seen, update their ballot_num
2. Send back a p1b message with their current state

**What This Means**: Acceptors are essentially "voting" on whether to consider a leader's proposal.

**The Result**: Only leaders with high enough ballot numbers can proceed.

### The P2A Protocol: Phase 2a (Accept)

**The Process**: When an acceptor receives a p2a message with a proposal:

**The Rules**:
1. Only accept proposals from the current ballot number
2. Add accepted proposals to their accepted list
3. Send back an OK response

**What This Means**: Acceptors ensure that only valid proposals are accepted.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency by following strict rules.

### Key Properties of Acceptors

**Ballot Numbers Always Increase**: Once an acceptor sees a higher ballot number, they never go back to a lower one.

**Only Accept Current Ballot Values**: Acceptors only accept values from the current ballot number.

**Never Remove Ballots**: Once a value is accepted, it's never removed.

**The Safety Guarantee**: If a value v is chosen by a majority on ballot b, then any value accepted by any acceptor in the same slot on ballot b' > b has the same value.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Acceptors provide the fault tolerance that makes the system reliable.

**The Elegance**: The simple rules ensure that the system maintains consistency.

**The Result**: Even if some acceptors fail, the system continues to work correctly.

## Leader Election: How Leaders Get Elected

Now let's explore how leaders actually get elected in PMMC, including the election process and what happens when leaders change.

### The Leader State

**What Leaders Track**:
- **active**: Whether they are currently the active leader
- **ballot_num**: Their current ballot number
- **proposals**: A list of proposals they want to make

**The Power**: This state allows leaders to coordinate the consensus process.

### The Election Process

**Step 1: Send P1A Messages**: The leader sends p1a messages to all acceptors with their ballot number.

**Step 2: Wait for Responses**: The leader waits for responses from a majority of acceptors.

**Step 3: Check Responses**: If the leader gets a majority of OK responses, they become the active leader.

**What This Means**: Leaders must win the support of a majority of acceptors to take control.

**The Result**: Only one leader can be active at a time.

### What Happens When Leaders Change

**The Scenario**: A new leader tries to take over from an existing leader.

**The Process**:
1. New leader sends p1a messages with a higher ballot number
2. Acceptors update their ballot numbers and send back their state
3. New leader becomes active and takes over

**What This Means**: Leadership can change dynamically as the system evolves.

**The Result**: The system can adapt to failures and changing conditions.

### When to Run for Office

**The Question**: When should a leader try to get elected?

**The Answer**: 
- At the beginning of time
- When the current leader seems to have failed

**The Implementation**: The paper describes an algorithm based on pinging the leader and timing out.

**The Key Insight**: If you get preempted, don't immediately try for election again!

**What This Means**: The system needs to avoid election storms where multiple leaders constantly compete.

**The Result**: The system stabilizes and maintains a single active leader.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Leader election is the foundation of the consensus process.

**The Elegance**: The system ensures that only one leader is active at a time.

**The Result**: The system can make progress even when individual leaders fail.

## Handling Proposals: How Leaders Process Client Requests

Now let's explore how leaders actually handle client proposals, including the process of getting them accepted by the system.

### The Proposal Process

**Step 1: Client Request**: A client sends a request to the leader (e.g., "Op1 should be A").

**Step 2: Add to Proposals**: The leader adds the proposal to their proposals list.

**Step 3: Send P2A Messages**: The leader sends p2a messages to all acceptors.

**Step 4: Wait for Responses**: The leader waits for responses from a majority of acceptors.

**Step 5: Check Success**: If the leader gets a majority of OK responses, the proposal is accepted.

**What This Means**: Leaders must coordinate with acceptors to get proposals accepted.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency by following strict rules.

### What Happens When Proposals Fail

**The Scenario**: A leader's proposal is rejected by acceptors.

**The Process**:
1. Leader receives rejection responses
2. Leader becomes inactive
3. Leader must re-run for election to continue

**What This Means**: Leaders can lose their position if they can't get proposals accepted.

**The Result**: The system ensures that only effective leaders remain in control.

### The Success Case

**The Scenario**: A leader's proposal is accepted by a majority of acceptors.

**The Process**:
1. Leader receives OK responses from majority
2. Proposal is committed to the log
3. Leader can continue processing more proposals

**What This Means**: Successful leaders can make progress and maintain control.

**The Result**: The system makes progress on client requests.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Proposal handling is the core of the consensus process.

**The Elegance**: The system ensures that only valid proposals are accepted.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency while processing client requests.

## Election Revisited: Handling Complex Scenarios

Now let's explore more complex election scenarios, including what happens when leaders have different states.

### The Complex Election Scenario

**The Setup**: 
- Leader has ballot_num: 3.0 and proposals: [<1, B>]
- Acceptor has ballot_num: 2.1 and accepted: [<2.1, 1, A>]

**The Process**:
1. Leader sends p1a(3.0) to acceptor
2. Acceptor updates ballot_num to 3.0
3. Acceptor sends back OK([<2.1, 1, A>])
4. Leader becomes active with proposals: [<1, A>]

**What This Means**: Leaders must adapt their proposals based on what acceptors have already accepted.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency even when leadership changes.

### Key Properties of Leaders

**Only Propose One Value Per Ballot and Slot**: Leaders ensure that each slot gets exactly one value.

**The Safety Guarantee**: If a value v is chosen by a majority on ballot b, then any value proposed by any leader in the same slot on ballot b' > b has the same value.

**What This Means**: Leaders cannot change values that have already been chosen.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency across leadership changes.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Leaders must respect the decisions made by previous leaders.

**The Elegance**: The system ensures that chosen values are never changed.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency even with dynamic leadership.

## Replicas: How the System Maintains Consistency

Now let's explore how replicas work in PMMC, including how they maintain the operation log and execute the state machine.

### The Replica Structure

**What Replicas Track**:
- **slot_out**: The next slot to output operations from
- **slot_in**: The next slot to input operations into

**The Power**: This structure allows replicas to maintain ordered execution of operations.

### The Operation Flow

**Step 1: Client Request**: A client sends a request (e.g., "Put k1 v1").

**Step 2: Leader Decision**: The leader decides on the operation (e.g., decision(3, "App k1 v1")).

**Step 3: Replica Execution**: The replica executes the operation in the appropriate slot.

**Step 4: State Update**: The replica updates its state based on the operation.

**What This Means**: Replicas execute operations in the order determined by the consensus protocol.

**The Result**: All replicas end up in the same state.

### The Slot Management

**The Process**:
1. Replicas track which slots have been filled
2. When a slot is filled, replicas execute the operation
3. Replicas move to the next slot

**What This Means**: Replicas ensure that operations are executed in the correct order.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency across all replicas.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Replicas are responsible for actually executing the operations.

**The Elegance**: The simple slot-based approach ensures ordered execution.

**The Result**: The system maintains consistency while processing client requests.

## Reconfiguration: Changing the System Configuration

Now let's explore how PMMC handles reconfiguration, including how to change the set of leaders and acceptors.

### The Reconfiguration Challenge

**The Problem**: All replicas must agree on who the leaders and acceptors are.

**The Question**: How do we do this?

**The Solution**: Use the log!

**What This Means**: Reconfiguration commands are treated like any other operation in the system.

**The Result**: The system can adapt to changing requirements.

### The Reconfiguration Process

**Step 1: Commit Reconfiguration Command**: A special reconfiguration command is committed to the log.

**Step 2: Wait for Window**: The new configuration applies after WINDOW slots.

**Step 3: Apply New Config**: The system switches to the new configuration.

**What This Means**: Reconfiguration is coordinated through the consensus protocol.

**The Result**: All replicas agree on the new configuration.

### Handling Immediate Reconfiguration

**The Question**: What if we need to reconfigure now and client requests aren't coming in?

**The Solution**: Commit no-ops until WINDOW is cleared.

**What This Means**: The system can force reconfiguration even without client activity.

**The Result**: The system can adapt quickly to changing requirements.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Reconfiguration is just another type of operation.

**The Elegance**: The system handles reconfiguration through the same consensus mechanism.

**The Result**: The system can adapt to changing requirements while maintaining consistency.

## Practical Considerations: Real-World Implementation Details

Now let's explore some practical considerations that make PMMC suitable for real-world deployment.

### State Simplifications

**The Challenge**: Tracking too much information can be expensive.

**The Solution**: Can track much less information, especially on replicas.

**What This Means**: The system can be optimized for performance.

**The Result**: The system can handle high throughput while maintaining correctness.

### Garbage Collection

**The Problem**: Unbounded memory growth is bad.

**The Solution**: Track finished slots across all instances, garbage collect when everyone has learned the result.

**What This Means**: The system can reclaim memory used by completed operations.

**The Result**: The system can run for long periods without memory issues.

### Read-Only Commands

**The Challenge**: Can't just read from replica (why?).

**The Solution**: Don't need their own slot.

**What This Means**: Read-only operations can be optimized.

**The Result**: The system can handle read-heavy workloads efficiently.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Practical considerations are as important as theoretical correctness.

**The Elegance**: The system balances correctness with performance.

**The Result**: The system can be deployed in real-world scenarios.

## Key Questions and Considerations

Now let's address some key questions that arise when implementing PMMC.

### What Should Be in Stable Storage?

**The Question**: What information needs to survive crashes?

**The Answer**: 
- Ballot numbers
- Accepted proposals
- Leader state

**What This Means**: The system must persist critical state to survive failures.

**The Result**: The system can recover from crashes and continue operating.

### Is Paxos Practical Enough?

**The Question**: What are the costs to using Paxos? Is it practical enough?

**The Answer**: 
- **Performance**: Paxos adds latency but provides strong consistency
- **Complexity**: The algorithm is complex but well-understood
- **Reliability**: Provides strong fault tolerance guarantees

**What This Means**: Paxos trades performance for correctness and reliability.

**The Result**: Paxos is suitable for systems that need strong consistency guarantees.

### The Fundamental Insight

**The Key Realization**: Practical systems must balance multiple competing requirements.

**The Elegance**: PMMC provides a practical implementation of Paxos.

**The Result**: The system can be deployed in real-world scenarios.

### The End of the Journey

PMMC represents a practical approach to implementing Paxos in real distributed systems. By addressing the practical concerns that the original algorithm doesn't cover, PMMC makes it possible to build reliable, fault-tolerant systems that actually work in production.

The journey from the theoretical elegance of Paxos to the practical implementation of PMMC shows how theory must be adapted to meet real-world constraints. The challenge is always the same: how do you build a distributed system that is both correct and practical?

PMMC provides an answer to this question, and it continues to influence how we build distributed systems today. The key insight is that practical distributed systems require more than just theoretical correctness—they need to address real-world concerns like performance, complexity, and maintainability.

By understanding PMMC, you gain insight into how to build distributed systems that are not only correct but also practical for real-world deployment. This knowledge is essential for anyone working on distributed systems, from researchers to practitioners.
