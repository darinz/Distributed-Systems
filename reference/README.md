## How to Use This Reference

### **Getting Started**
1. **Start with the comprehensive guide**: `01_Distributed-Systems/README.md` for the complete overview
2. **Choose your learning path** based on your experience level (see Learning Paths above)
3. **Read main documents first** (e.g., `07-1_Paxos.md`) then review implementation notes
4. **Connect theory to practice** by studying real production systems
5. **Focus on trade-offs** rather than memorizing algorithms

### **Study Approach**
- **For each topic**: Read main document → Review notes → Understand trade-offs → Connect to real systems
- **Key questions**: What problem does this solve? What are the limitations? How does it handle failures?
- **Practice**: Apply concepts to system design problems and real-world scenarios
