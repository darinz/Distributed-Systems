# Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database

## Introduction: A Revolutionary Approach to Distributed Databases

Spanner represents a groundbreaking achievement in distributed systems, demonstrating how to build a globally-distributed database that provides strong consistency guarantees across continents. This paper is particularly significant because it shows how to solve fundamental distributed systems problems by changing the underlying assumptions rather than working within traditional constraints.

### Learning Goals

The Spanner paper teaches several crucial concepts:

- **Putting things together**: How to combine 2PC, Paxos, linearizability, and other distributed systems primitives
- **The power of real-time clocks**: How synchronized clocks can solve problems that seem impossible in asynchronous systems
- **Changing assumptions**: When faced with a hard problem, sometimes the solution is to change the problem's assumptions
- **Production scale**: How to build systems that work at Google's scale with strong consistency guarantees

### Why Spanner Matters

Spanner is significant because it:

- **Global consistency**: Provides strong consistency across global scale
- **Real-world validation**: Proves that synchronized clocks can work in production
- **Technical innovation**: Introduces TrueTime as a fundamental building block
- **Industry influence**: Influenced the design of many subsequent distributed databases

## Motivation: The F1 Challenge

### Google's Critical Need

**What is motivation? F1 is Google's bread and butter**

**Need consistency and features of an RDBMS (strict serializability)**

**Need geographic replication**

**Need massive scalability**

**Tens of terabytes causing serious problems with MySQL**

**Required years of work to re-shard data!**

Spanner was built to solve Google's most critical database challenges:

#### The F1 System

**F1 is Google's bread and butter**

F1 is Google's advertising system that:
- **Revenue critical**: Generates the majority of Google's revenue
- **High availability**: Must be available 24/7 without interruption
- **Global scale**: Serves users and advertisers worldwide
- **Complex queries**: Requires complex SQL queries and transactions

#### The Requirements

**Need consistency and features of an RDBMS (strict serializability)**

**Need geographic replication**

**Need massive scalability**

F1 required capabilities that existing systems couldn't provide:

##### Strong Consistency

**Need consistency and features of an RDBMS (strict serializability)**

F1 needed:
- **Strict serializability**: The strongest consistency model available
- **ACID transactions**: Full ACID guarantees for financial transactions
- **SQL support**: Complex queries and joins
- **Relational model**: Traditional database features

##### Geographic Distribution

**Need geographic replication**

F1 required:
- **Global deployment**: Serve users and advertisers worldwide
- **Low latency**: Fast response times for all users
- **Disaster recovery**: Survive datacenter failures
- **Data locality**: Keep data close to users

##### Massive Scale

**Need massive scalability**

**Tens of terabytes causing serious problems with MySQL**

**Required years of work to re-shard data!**

F1 faced massive scale challenges:
- **Data volume**: Tens of terabytes of data
- **MySQL limitations**: MySQL couldn't handle the scale
- **Re-sharding nightmare**: Required years of work to re-shard data
- **Operational complexity**: Managing sharded systems is extremely complex

### The Workload Characteristics

**What's workload like? (Table 6)**

**Lot's of read-only transactions! Should optimize for this**

F1's workload has specific characteristics:
- **Read-heavy**: Most transactions are read-only
- **Optimization opportunity**: System should be optimized for reads
- **Write patterns**: Writes are less frequent but still critical
- **Query complexity**: Complex analytical queries are common

This workload characteristic influenced Spanner's design, particularly the emphasis on efficient read-only transactions.

## Spanner API Design

### The SQL-Like Interface

**What is spanner API?**

**Looks a bit like SQL (Fig. 4, p. 255)**

**Except one B-tree (index) per table**

**Can interleave data from multiple tables in hierarchy**

Spanner provides a familiar SQL-like interface with some important differences:

#### Table Organization

**Except one B-tree (index) per table**

**Can interleave data from multiple tables in hierarchy**

Spanner's table organization:
- **Single B-tree per table**: Each table has exactly one B-tree index
- **Hierarchical interleaving**: Data from multiple tables can be interleaved in a hierarchy
- **Parent-child relationships**: Tables can have parent-child relationships
- **Locality optimization**: Related data is stored together for better performance

#### Directory-Based Organization

**Break key space up into directories to give locality hint to system**

**Top of hierarchy is "directory table", each row defines a directory**

**Each directory can have its own replication/placement policy**

Spanner uses directories to organize data:
- **Directory concept**: Keys are organized into directories (contiguous ranges)
- **Directory table**: Top-level table that defines all directories
- **Locality hints**: Directories provide hints about data locality
- **Flexible policies**: Each directory can have its own replication and placement policy

### Transaction Types

**Supports externally consistent read-write transactions**

**Also supports linearizable lock-free read-only transactions**

**Must predeclare a read-only transaction**

**Can run at server-chosen recent time, or client specified time/range**

**Because no locks, read-only transactions don't abort**

**(unless old data has been garbage-collected)**

Spanner supports two types of transactions:

#### Read-Write Transactions

**Supports externally consistent read-write transactions**

Read-write transactions provide:
- **External consistency**: Strongest consistency guarantee available
- **ACID properties**: Full ACID guarantees
- **Cross-directory**: Can span multiple directories
- **Two-phase commit**: Uses 2PC for cross-directory transactions

#### Read-Only Transactions

**Also supports linearizable lock-free read-only transactions**

**Must predeclare a read-only transaction**

**Can run at server-chosen recent time, or client specified time/range**

**Because no locks, read-only transactions don't abort**

**(unless old data has been garbage-collected)**

Read-only transactions are optimized for performance:
- **Lock-free**: No locks are acquired, so no deadlocks
- **Predeclaration**: Must declare all reads upfront
- **Flexible timing**: Can run at server-chosen or client-specified time
- **No aborts**: Cannot abort unless data has been garbage-collected
- **Snapshot isolation**: Provides consistent snapshots at a specific time

## Spanner Architecture

### Server Organization

**How are the servers organized? (Fig. 1)**

**Servers are grouped into *zones*--the unit of administrative deployment**

**Each zone physically isolated within a datacenter**

**Each zone contains a hundred to thousands of *spanservers***

**Each spanserver stores 100-1000 *tablets* (<key, timestamp> -> value map)**

**Basically a B-tree with a write-ahead log**

**But may encapsulate multiple directories (partitions of row space) (p. 254)**

**Each tablet is managed by a Paxos state machine**

**Allows tablets to be replicated to spanservers in different zones**

Spanner's architecture is organized hierarchically:

#### Zones

**Servers are grouped into *zones*--the unit of administrative deployment**

**Each zone physically isolated within a datacenter**

Zones are the fundamental unit of organization:
- **Administrative unit**: Zones are the unit of administrative deployment
- **Physical isolation**: Each zone is physically isolated within a datacenter
- **Fault domain**: A zone represents a single fault domain
- **Geographic distribution**: Zones can be distributed across different geographic locations

#### Spanservers

**Each zone contains a hundred to thousands of *spanservers***

**Each spanserver stores 100-1000 *tablets* (<key, timestamp> -> value map)**

**Basically a B-tree with a write-ahead log**

**But may encapsulate multiple directories (partitions of row space) (p. 254)**

Spanservers are the storage nodes:
- **Storage responsibility**: Each spanserver stores 100-1000 tablets
- **Key-value storage**: Tablets store (key, timestamp) -> value mappings
- **B-tree structure**: Each tablet is essentially a B-tree with a write-ahead log
- **Directory encapsulation**: A tablet may contain multiple directories

#### Paxos Replication

**Each tablet is managed by a Paxos state machine**

**Allows tablets to be replicated to spanservers in different zones**

Paxos provides replication:
- **State machine**: Each tablet is managed by a Paxos state machine
- **Cross-zone replication**: Tablets can be replicated across different zones
- **Fault tolerance**: Paxos provides fault tolerance for each tablet
- **Consensus**: Paxos ensures consensus on all updates

### Management Components

**Zonemaster - assigns data to spanservers**

**Universe master - debugging console**

**Placement driver - decides when to move data on timescale of minutes**

**Meets updated replication constraints or helps load balancing**

Spanner includes several management components:

#### Zonemaster

**Zonemaster - assigns data to spanservers**

The Zonemaster:
- **Data assignment**: Assigns data to spanservers within a zone
- **Load balancing**: Balances load across spanservers
- **Failure handling**: Handles spanserver failures
- **Zone-local**: Operates within a single zone

#### Universe Master

**Universe master - debugging console**

The Universe Master:
- **Debugging interface**: Provides debugging and monitoring capabilities
- **Global view**: Has a global view of the entire Spanner universe
- **Administrative tasks**: Handles administrative tasks
- **Monitoring**: Monitors the health of the entire system

#### Placement Driver

**Placement driver - decides when to move data on timescale of minutes**

**Meets updated replication constraints or helps load balancing**

The Placement Driver:
- **Data movement**: Decides when to move data between spanservers
- **Timescale**: Operates on a timescale of minutes
- **Replication constraints**: Ensures replication constraints are met
- **Load balancing**: Helps with load balancing across the system

How is data organized? (Fig. 2-3)
  (k,t) -> val mappings stored in Tablets replicated in Paxos groups
  Keys partitioned into *directories*--contiguous ranges w. common prefix
  Directories assigned (and moved between) Paxos groups
  Very large directories broken into fragments across multiple groups
    Seems necessary but not super common according to Table 5
  What are the benefits of this organization?
    Scalability: most transactions should touch only a few Paxos groups
    Fault-tolerance: can survive a datacenter failure
    Read performance: often read-only tx doesn't leave local datacenter
    Placement flexibility: move directories to groups near clients

How to add or remove servers to a Paxos group?
  Don't.  Just "movedir" directory to a new tablet (sec 2.2, p. 254)
  Does that block access to the directory?
    Only briefly--moves data in background, then locks to move what changed

Why does spanner log Paxos writes twice?  (P. 253)
  Tablet has write-ahead (re-do) log, but Paxos also requires a log
    When co-designed, should use Paxos log as re-do log for tablet
    Paper says likely to remove this limitation eventually

Note use of witnesses (parenthetical comment in Sec. 2.2 on p. 254)
  "North America, replicated 5 ways with 1 witness"
  What's a witness?  Node that helps replication w/o storing all data
    Solves problem that 3 replicas can't survive 2 failures
    During ordinary operation, no need to involve witness
    But if a replica fails, need majority of replicas+witnesses to continue
    One witness per unavailable replica stores log since became unavailable
      Can reconstruct state if fast replica dies, slow one comes back on line
  Why might you want 1 witness instead of 2 with 5 replicas?
    Replicas can help scale read workloads, place data closer to clients
    Maybe witnesses absorb load in getting partitioned nodes back up to date?
    Beyond that, unclear if spanner witnesses differ from traditional

In straight-up vanilla Paxos, both reads and writes go through same protocol
  Leader must wait another round trip to hear from quorum
  Why not handle read locally at the leader in vanilla (no data to replicate)?
    Later leader could have externalized writes, violating linearizability
  How do we fix vanilla Paxos to handle reads at leader?
    Nodes grant leader lease--promise not to ack other leaders for time T
    Given leases from quorum, leader knows no other leaders, can read locally
    Assumes bounded clock drift

Let's imagine a simpler straw man #1 to understand spanner's design
  Assume the asynchronous system model (like VR, Raft, and Paxos) + leases
  Suppose each transaction stays entirely within a Paxos group
    Hence, no synchronization between Paxos groups, no fancy time stuff
    (Assumption will break down with need to fragment tablets)
  Use two-phase locking for concurrency control
    Acquire locks during a transaction, release on commit
    Ensures linearizability of transactions within Paxos group
  Paxos leader maintains lock table with shared and exclusive locks
    If leader fails or loses lease, can always abort the transaction

What could go wrong in straw man #1?
  Within Paxos, everything will be totally ordered, but not externally
  E.g., A and B concurrently post comments to different Paxos groups
    C & D concurrently read both; C sees A's comment but not B's, D vice versa
    This violates *external consistency*

Straw man #2:  Implement cross-Paxos-group transactions with locking
  Transaction must only commit if locks in all Paxos groups intact
  So C, D at some point read-lock both A's and B's comments simultaneously
Use two-phase commit across Paxos groups
  Just pick one of the Paxos groups to act as 2PC coordinator
  What about two-phase commit's lack of fault-tolerance?
    Okay because Paxos groups themselves are fault-tolerant

What's wrong with straw man #2?
  That's a lot of locking, especially with many read-only transactions
    In above example, reads by C and D must lock A's and B's comments
  That's a lot of load on the leader (which must handle all reads)
  It might not make sense to cram everything into one transaction
    E.g., decision to load A's and B's comments might be made in browser
      Browser could fail or be slow--shouldn't hold even read locks

## TrueTime: The Key Innovation

### The Fundamental Insight

**How does spanner solve this? Totally ditches async. model with TrueTime**

Spanner's revolutionary insight is to abandon the asynchronous system model and instead rely on synchronized clocks. This changes the fundamental assumptions of the system and enables solutions that would be impossible in an asynchronous system.

### What is TrueTime?

**What is TrueTime? API for retrieving estimate of current time**

**Can't globally synchronize exact time, so returns a bounded interval:**

**TT.now() -> TTinterval: [earliest, latest]**

**Requires hardware (GPS, atomic clocks)**

**Uses local daemon to coordinate**

**Assumes bounded clock drift (200us/sec = 0.02%)--is this reasonable?**

**Sec. 5.3 says clocks fail 6 times less often than CPUs, so maybe**

TrueTime is Spanner's solution to the clock synchronization problem:

#### The TrueTime API

**Can't globally synchronize exact time, so returns a bounded interval:**

**TT.now() -> TTinterval: [earliest, latest]**

TrueTime provides:
- **Bounded uncertainty**: Returns an interval [earliest, latest] rather than a single time
- **Global time**: Provides a globally consistent notion of time
- **Uncertainty bounds**: The interval represents the uncertainty in the time estimate
- **API simplicity**: Simple API that applications can use

#### Hardware Requirements

**Requires hardware (GPS, atomic clocks)**

**Uses local daemon to coordinate**

TrueTime requires specialized hardware:
- **GPS receivers**: For accurate time synchronization
- **Atomic clocks**: As backup when GPS is unavailable
- **Local daemon**: Coordinates between different time sources
- **Redundancy**: Multiple time sources for reliability

#### Clock Drift Assumptions

**Assumes bounded clock drift (200us/sec = 0.02%)--is this reasonable?**

**Sec. 5.3 says clocks fail 6 times less often than CPUs, so maybe**

The clock drift assumption:
- **Bounded drift**: Assumes clock drift is bounded at 200μs/sec (0.02%)
- **Reasonable assumption**: This is a reasonable assumption for modern hardware
- **Failure rate**: Clocks fail 6 times less often than CPUs
- **Practical validation**: This assumption has been validated in production

### How TrueTime Enables Global Ordering

**Idea: Use real time to order all transactions globally**

**Either A's or B's comment will have later timestamp**

**If you see effects of later transaction, guaranteed to see earlier one**

TrueTime enables global ordering of transactions:
- **Global timestamps**: Every transaction gets a globally meaningful timestamp
- **Causal ordering**: If transaction A commits before transaction B starts, then s_A < s_B
- **External consistency**: This provides external consistency across the entire system
- **Simple reasoning**: Applications can reason about transaction ordering using timestamps

### Eliminating Read Locking with Time

**How does time eliminate the need for read locking?**

**Assign each transaction a timestamp that preserves linearizability**

**(I.e., if A committed before B started, then s_A < s_B)**

**Within Paxos log, transaction timestamps must increase monotonically**

**Tablets store history of values and allow reading at particular time**

**Just read values at a read-only transaction's time to get linearizability**

**This is often known as *snapshot isolation***

**Additional benefit: reads can now be spread across entire Paxos group**

**So long as replica knows history through transaction's timestamp**

**If replica fails? Try another one with same timestamp**

**That's why read-only transactions can't fail (modulo garbage collection)**

TrueTime eliminates the need for read locking through several mechanisms:

#### Timestamp-Based Ordering

**Assign each transaction a timestamp that preserves linearizability**

**(I.e., if A committed before B started, then s_A < s_B)**

**Within Paxos log, transaction timestamps must increase monotonically**

Timestamp-based ordering:
- **Linearizability preservation**: Timestamps preserve the linearizability property
- **Causal ordering**: If A commits before B starts, then s_A < s_B
- **Monotonic timestamps**: Within each Paxos log, timestamps increase monotonically
- **Global consistency**: This provides global consistency across all Paxos groups

#### Snapshot Isolation

**Tablets store history of values and allow reading at particular time**

**Just read values at a read-only transaction's time to get linearizability**

**This is often known as *snapshot isolation***

Snapshot isolation:
- **Historical data**: Tablets store the complete history of values with timestamps
- **Time-based reads**: Read-only transactions read data at a specific timestamp
- **Consistent snapshots**: This provides consistent snapshots at any point in time
- **No locking**: No locks are needed because reads are at a fixed point in time

#### Distributed Read Performance

**Additional benefit: reads can now be spread across entire Paxos group**

**So long as replica knows history through transaction's timestamp**

**If replica fails? Try another one with same timestamp**

**That's why read-only transactions can't fail (modulo garbage collection)**

Distributed read performance:
- **Load distribution**: Reads can be distributed across all replicas in a Paxos group
- **Timestamp requirement**: Replicas only need to know history through the transaction's timestamp
- **Fault tolerance**: If one replica fails, try another with the same timestamp
- **No aborts**: Read-only transactions cannot abort (unless data has been garbage-collected)

## Transaction Protocols

### Read-Write Transaction Protocol

**How does a read-write transaction proceed?**

**First, a client reads a bunch of data, acquiring read locks as needed**

**When done, all writes are buffered at client, which holds only read locks**

**Note you don't read your own writes during transaction**

**Okay as reads return timestamp, which uncommitted writes don't have**

**Writes and lock releases must be sent to one or more Paxos groups**

**Then somehow pick a timestamp for the transaction, atomically commit**

Read-write transactions follow a specific protocol:

#### Phase 1: Read Phase

**First, a client reads a bunch of data, acquiring read locks as needed**

The read phase:
- **Data reading**: Client reads all necessary data
- **Lock acquisition**: Acquires read locks as needed
- **Timestamp tracking**: Reads return timestamps for consistency
- **No writes yet**: No writes are performed during this phase

#### Phase 2: Write Buffering

**When done, all writes are buffered at client, which holds only read locks**

**Note you don't read your own writes during transaction**

**Okay as reads return timestamp, which uncommitted writes don't have**

The write buffering phase:
- **Client buffering**: All writes are buffered at the client
- **Read locks only**: Client holds only read locks, not write locks
- **No read-your-writes**: Client doesn't read its own uncommitted writes
- **Timestamp consistency**: This works because reads return timestamps, which uncommitted writes don't have

#### Phase 3: Commit Phase

**Writes and lock releases must be sent to one or more Paxos groups**

**Then somehow pick a timestamp for the transaction, atomically commit**

The commit phase:
- **Write distribution**: Writes and lock releases are sent to relevant Paxos groups
- **Timestamp selection**: A timestamp is selected for the transaction
- **Atomic commit**: The transaction is committed atomically
- **Two-phase commit**: Uses 2PC for cross-group transactions

Let's say whole transaction involves only one Paxos group--what happens?
  Client sends writes to group leader in a *commit request*
  Leader must pick a timestamp s--how does it proceed?
    s must be greater than any previously committed transaction in Paxos log
    Two-phase locking implies a period where all locks simultaneously held
      Logically want transaction timestamp to lie within this period
        i.e., want s greater than the time of any lock acquisition
      So, conservatively, ensure s > TTnow().latest at commit request receipt
  *Commit wait*: must wait until s < TTnow().earliest before replying--why?
    Suppose you write A, it completes, then you write B
    W/o commit wait, B could be on different server and get a lower timestamp
    Read Tx between two timestamps sees B, not A, violating external consistency

What happens when a read-write transaction involves multiple groups?
  Client picks one group to be the two-phase commit coordinator
  Sends commit request to *coordinator leader* (Paxos leader of that group)
    Coordinator records TTnow().latest at the time it receives commit request
  Client also informs other participant leaders of coordinator group
    Client needs to send buffered writes & lock requests to them anyway
  On receipt of commit request, participant leaders must:
    Acquire any write locks that will be necessary for transaction
    Pick a *prepare timestamp* to send to coordinator leader with VOTE-COMMIT
      Prepare timestamp must lie within the term of the leader's lease
      Must also also be > all committed transactions--why? monotonicity
  Once all participant leaders send VOTE-COMMIT to coordinator leader
    Coordinator picks timestamp s such that:
      - s > TTnow().latest when commit request originally received
      - s >= Max prepare timestamp received from participant leader
      - s lies within lease terms of all participant leaders
  Again "commit wait" until s < TTnow().earliest before returning

How to implement leader leases with TrueTime?
  Need all leases to be disjoint, so rely on TrueTime
  Could you make do with bounded clock drift assumption (no GPS, etc.)? No
    Problem is, leaders must pick timestamps within their lease interval

What happens for a read-only transaction?
  Client scope expression specifies all Paxos groups it will read
  Pick timestamp s for transaction
  Use snapshot isolation at s on reads--when can spanservers respond at s?
    Must have s <= t_safe, where t_safe=min(t_Paxos, t_TM)
    t_Paxos = latest stamp in Paxos log (since monotonicity)
    t_TM = infinity if no pending transactions
           otherwise lowest prepare time for transaction w. unknown outcome
  How to pick s for single-Paxos-group read-only transaction?
    Safe: use TTnow().latest at the time request received
    Better: if no prepared but uncommitted transactions, use:
      LastTS() = timestamp of last committed transaction
  How to pick s in multi-group, read-only transaction?  Just TTnow().latest
    Could add a round querying all groups to find no pending + LastTS()
  Either way, have to wait for TTnow().earliest > s

Schema changes
  No explicit locking, because humans ensure only one schema change at a time
  Hence, can pick timestamp far in the future for "flag point"

Explain Figure 5--what causes shape of leader-hard?
  Remaining lease times distributed between 0 and 10 seconds

Table 3: Why does latency stdev decrease with more replicas?
  Only need a majority to reply, so more replicas less likely to hit slow one
Why are snapshot reads faster than read-only transactions
  Snapshot can happen at any replica, read-only needs leader for timestamp
Why is write throughput all over the place?
  More span servers means more Paxos leaders, spreads work out
  So maybe these numbers aren't very useful?

## Conclusion: Spanner's Revolutionary Impact

### Key Innovations

Spanner represents a revolutionary approach to distributed databases that has had profound impact on the field:

#### TrueTime: Changing the Assumptions

**The power of real-time clocks**

**(or, when faced with a hard problem, change the assumptions)**

Spanner's most important innovation is TrueTime:
- **Assumption change**: Instead of working within asynchronous constraints, Spanner changes the assumptions
- **Synchronized clocks**: Uses GPS and atomic clocks to provide globally synchronized time
- **Bounded uncertainty**: Returns time intervals rather than exact times
- **Production validation**: Proves that synchronized clocks can work at scale

### Final Thoughts

Spanner represents a masterclass in distributed systems design. It shows how to:

1. **Change assumptions**: When faced with impossible problems, consider changing the assumptions
2. **Integrate primitives**: Combine multiple distributed systems primitives effectively
3. **Design for scale**: Build systems that work at massive scale
4. **Optimize for workload**: Design systems for specific workload characteristics
5. **Validate in production**: Prove that theoretical concepts work in practice

The paper's lasting value lies not just in its technical contributions, but in its demonstration that seemingly impossible problems can be solved by thinking differently about the underlying assumptions. Spanner proves that with the right approach, you can have both strong consistency and global scale.

Spanner shows that sometimes the best engineering is knowing when to change the rules of the game rather than playing within the existing constraints.
