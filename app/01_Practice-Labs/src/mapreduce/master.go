// Package mapreduce implements the master process for distributed MapReduce execution.
//
// This file contains the core logic for the MapReduce master, which coordinates
// the execution of map and reduce tasks across multiple worker processes.
// The master is responsible for:
//   - Accepting worker registrations
//   - Distributing map and reduce jobs to available workers
//   - Tracking job completion and handling worker failures
//   - Coordinating the overall MapReduce workflow
//
// The master uses a channel-based architecture to manage worker availability
// and job distribution, ensuring efficient parallel execution of tasks.

// WorkerInfo contains information about a registered worker process.
//
// This structure tracks the state and metadata for each worker that
// has registered with the master. It is used for job assignment,
// failure tracking, and cleanup operations.
//
// Fields:
//   - address: Network address of the worker process (e.g., "localhost:7778")
//
// Additional fields can be added here to track worker state, such as:
//   - Last heartbeat time
//   - Number of completed jobs
//   - Worker capabilities or load
//   - Failure count
type WorkerInfo struct {
	address string // Network address of the worker process
	// Additional worker metadata can be added here
}

// KillWorkers gracefully shuts down all registered workers and collects statistics.
//
// This method sends a shutdown RPC to each registered worker, requesting
// them to terminate gracefully. It collects the number of jobs each worker
// has performed and returns this information as a list.
//
// The method is typically called at the end of a MapReduce job to clean up
// worker processes and gather execution statistics.
//
// Returns:
//   - *list.List: List of integers representing the number of jobs completed by each worker
//
// Note: Workers that fail to respond to the shutdown request are logged
// but do not cause the method to fail.

// RunMaster orchestrates the execution of all map and reduce tasks.
//
// This is the main coordination function that manages the entire MapReduce
// workflow. It starts worker registration handling, distributes map tasks,
// waits for map completion, distributes reduce tasks, waits for reduce
// completion, and finally shuts down all workers.
//
// The method uses goroutines to enable parallel execution of tasks while
// using channels to synchronize completion and manage worker availability.
//
// Execution Flow:
//   1. Start worker registration handler
//   2. Launch all map tasks in parallel
//   3. Wait for all map tasks to complete
//   4. Launch all reduce tasks in parallel
//   5. Wait for all reduce tasks to complete
//   6. Shutdown all workers and collect statistics
//
// Returns:
//   - *list.List: Statistics about jobs completed by each worker
//
// Implementation hints:
//   - Start registerWorkers() in a separate goroutine
//   - Launch map jobs in parallel using goroutines
//   - Wait for all map jobs to complete using doneChannel
//   - Launch reduce jobs in parallel using goroutines
//   - Wait for all reduce jobs to complete using doneChannel
//   - Return the result of KillWorkers()

// registerWorkers continuously accepts worker registrations and makes them available for jobs.
//
// This method runs in a separate goroutine and handles the registration
// of new workers. When a worker registers, it is added to the worker
// registry and placed on the ready channel, making it available for
// job assignment.
//
// The method runs indefinitely, allowing workers to register at any time
// during the MapReduce execution. This supports dynamic worker scaling
// and handles workers that may start up after the master begins execution.
//
// Registration Process:
//   1. Wait for a worker to register via registerChannel
//   2. Create WorkerInfo entry for the worker
//   3. Add worker to the ready channel for job assignment
//
// Implementation hints:
//   - Use an infinite loop to continuously accept registrations
//   - Read worker address from mr.registerChannel
//   - Add worker to mr.Workers map with WorkerInfo
//   - Send worker address to mr.readyChannel to make it available

// delegateJob assigns a specific job to an available worker and handles retries.
//
// This method is responsible for finding an available worker and assigning
// a specific map or reduce job to it. If the assignment fails (e.g., worker
// is unresponsive), it will retry with the next available worker.
//
// The method implements fault tolerance by automatically retrying failed
// job assignments with different workers, ensuring that all jobs eventually
// complete successfully.
//
// Parameters:
//   - jtype: Type of job (Map or Reduce)
//   - jno: Zero-based job number
//
// Execution Flow:
//   1. Wait for an available worker from readyChannel
//   2. Attempt to assign the job to the worker
//   3. If successful: signal completion and return worker to ready pool
//   4. If failed: retry with next available worker
//
// Implementation hints:
//   - Use a retry loop that continues until job succeeds
//   - Get available worker from mr.readyChannel
//   - Call mr.assignJob() to attempt job assignment
//   - On success: signal completion and return worker to pool
//   - On failure: continue loop to try with another worker

// assignJob sends a job assignment RPC to a specific worker.
//
// This method constructs the appropriate job arguments based on the job type
// and sends an RPC request to the specified worker. The arguments include
// all necessary information for the worker to execute the job.
//
// Parameters:
//   - worker: Network address of the worker to assign the job to
//   - jtype: Type of job (Map or Reduce)
//   - jno: Zero-based job number
//
// Returns:
//   - bool: True if the RPC call succeeded and the worker accepted the job
//
// Job Arguments:
//   - Map jobs: File name, job number, and number of reduce tasks (for partitioning)
//   - Reduce jobs: File name, job number, and number of map tasks (for input collection)
//
// Implementation hints:
//   - Create DoJobArgs struct with appropriate fields
//   - Use switch statement to handle Map vs Reduce job types
//   - For Map jobs: set NumOtherPhase to mr.nReduce
//   - For Reduce jobs: set NumOtherPhase to mr.nMap
//   - Use call() function to send RPC to worker
